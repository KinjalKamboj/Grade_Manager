# Project Name: 
* Grade Manager
------------------------------------
# Project Developer: 
* Kinjal Kamboj
------------------------------------
# Project Status:
  * Started on May 19, 2021
  * Completed on May 24, 2021
------------------------------------
# Requirements: 
  * Any desktop system with the latest version of Eclipse IDE downloaded.
------------------------------------
# Introduction: 
  * This calculator is specifically created for grade 12 students at St. Marcellinus (although, grade 11s can use it too) to calculate their top 6 average, calculate the mark needed on their final to achieve their desired average, any scholarships available for their grade and to create their own transcript before logging out of the program.
------------------------------------
# Usage: 
  * Upon running the program, the title frame will display, prompting the user to enter the appropiate username and password. The user can also transition to the instruction frame from the title frame and back. After logging in, the main frame will display where the user can enter their grades, calculate their marks, see any scholarships, create their transcript before exiting and log out.
------------------------------------
# Troubleshooting: 
   * Ensure that the project runs in a Java environment that supports GUI.
   * Ensure all files are correctly placed in their source folder: images in "Resource" folder and text files inside the project folder. 
   * If further assistance is needed, contact the developer.

# FAQ
   * Q: How do I login?
   * * A: The required username and password is given in the Instructions frame and the TitleFrame file. To access the instructions, click the instructions button on the login frame after you've opened the application. A more time consuming method would be to search for it amongst the code in the TitleFrame file.
   * Q: I don't see the option to create my transcript, how do I create one?
   * * A: Click on the logout button on the main frame after you've logged in. It will display another pane that will ask the user to confirm if they wish to exit the program. Click yes, and another pane will show up asking if you wish to create your transcript before you exit. After you've clicked yes again, the program will prompt you to enter the required information on the console.
